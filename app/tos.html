  </ol>
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-left: 60px;">
  <li>The Fan Favorite/People&rsquo;s Choice winner for each Measure Up Challenge will be determined by public voting, and registered users of the App will be able to vote (up to one time per Submission) for their favorite video, by following the instructions contained in the App during the Contest Period.

  <li>The HEED Technical winner, will be determined by HEED&rsquo;s proprietary similarity scoring algorithm and software program, which measures the angle and technical similarity of the Submission to the original Measure Up Challenge. The Submission with the highest HEED Pro-Score, as determined by Sponsor&rsquo;s software, will be deemed the winner.&nbsp; In the event the same person received the highest score for two unique Submissions, s/he will be awarded the prize where his/her score is the highest and be disqualified from the other Measure Up Challenge(s). Judging will be done on or about one (1) week after the close of the Contest Period, but no later than May 31, 2018.
